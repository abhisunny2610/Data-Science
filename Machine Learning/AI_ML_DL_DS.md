## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
------
**Artificial intelligence(AI)** is the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing speeech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. \
or \
`smart applications that can perform its own task without any human intervention.`


**Examples:** Robots, Alexa, Self drivinf cars



## Machine Learning (ML)
----
**Machine Learning** is a branch of **AI** thats develops algorithms by learning the hidden patterns of the dataset used it to make predictions on new similar type data, without being explicitly programmed for each task. \
or \
`it provide statstool for visualize, analyze, predective models or forecasting.`

**Examples:** Recommendation System, fraud detection, automated task etc.



## Deep Learning (DL)
-----
**Deep learning** is the branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.

In a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.


**Examples:** Object detection and recognition, Image classification, Image segmentation etc.


## Data Science (DS)
----
**Data Science** is a concept that brings together ideas, data examination, machine learning, and their related strategies to comprehend and dissect genuine phenomena with data.
